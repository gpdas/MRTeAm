Current
-------

auctioneer:

  self.tasks is populated from script or timed event

  while self.tasks is not empty:
    allocate, remove from self.tasks


robot_controller:

  announce -> bid
  win -> add to self.agenda



Redistribute
------------

auctioneer:

  while self.tasks HAS INCOMPLETE TASKS:
    allocate INCOMPLETE TASKS, DO NOT REMOVE from self.tasks

robot_controller:

  ALLOCATION_START -> delete unfinished tasks from self.agenda, send AGENDA_CLEARED

  announce -> bid
  win -> add to self.agenda



For safety
----------
Add an AGENDA_CLEARED type to the TaskStatus message definition. After a
BEGIN_ALLOCATION event, auctioneer will wait to receive an AGENDA_CLEARED
(TaskStatus) message from all team members before running the allocation.


Things to check
---------------

1) a. Does auctioneer allocate all tasks in self.tasks? Or only imcomplete ones?
   b. Does auctioneer remove tasks from self.tasks when they are allocated?

2) Make "static/redistribute" a configurable option


TODO
----
Change robot_controller arguments into parameters:

  robot_name
  reallocate
  is_turtlebot
