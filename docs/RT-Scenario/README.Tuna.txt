Hi Eric, 

The git repo is not under hrteam so I attached a tarball containing a collection of training + used + unused scenarios for my experiments. Scenario-[0-4].conf are training scenarios (they only have a few tasks), Scenario-[5-12].conf are the ones that I've used for the experiments, the ones with the 'original' word in the label are the unused ones. Feel free to use whichever works best for you. 

Betsy said you already have the TCAT experiment scenarios and your system works with that format or something similar to it. The only difference between this one and those are the additional "arrival_time" (in seconds) right after the "task" keyword. The rest of the parameters are the same.
