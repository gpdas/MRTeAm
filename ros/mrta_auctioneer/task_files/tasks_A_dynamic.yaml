# One task per line.
# Fields are:
#   <start_secs> <x> <y> <num_robots> <duration>
# where
#
#  start_secs   Seconds after the experiment begins that task 'appears'
#  x            The task's x-coordinate location on the map (in meters)
#  y            The task's x-coordinate location on the map (in meters)
#  num_robots   How many robots are required to complete this task
#  duration     How many seconds are required to 'execute' this task
