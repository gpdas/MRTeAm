# task_id:      A unique identifier.
# type:         Just 'SENSOR_SWEEP' for now, but may also include 'FIRE' or 'DEBRIS' in the future.
# arrival_time: Time (seconds) after start of an experiment that the task "appears"
# location:     x,y coordinates of the task's location
# num_robots:   Number of robots required to complete the task
# duration:     Time (seconds) required to complete the task
# depends:      Array of tasks (task_ids) that this task depends on; i.e., tasks that must be
#               completed before this one can start.
